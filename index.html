        <h2 id="home">About My Topic</h2>
        <p>The problem my topic covers is the lack of access to quality educational resources for students in underserved communities. This is a significant issue as it hampers academic success and limits future opportunities for these students.</p>

        <h2>Why is it important?</h2>
        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6NYWISpMznc?si=zzS6GXoCrit6ocE5" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p>Just like planting seeds and nurturing them with sunlight and water, we must invest in students by providing the educational resources they need to grow. Each child holds incredible potential, like a young seed waiting to become a strong tree. For these seeds to flourish, they need faith, encouragement, and access to knowledge.
            <br></br>Educational resources‚Äîbooks, technology, mentorship‚Äîare the nutrients that help students expand their skills and reach new heights. When we provide these tools, we‚Äôre not just supporting individual growth; we‚Äôre cultivating future leaders and contributors to society. By investing in education, we‚Äôre building a forest of strong, resilient individuals who will stand tall, support their communities, and inspire others.</p>
